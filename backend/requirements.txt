# Note: We've removed the following dependencies that require complex builds:
# - face-recognition (requires dlib and CMake)
# - opencv-python-headless (can be complex to install)
#
# The application will use alternative methods for security that don't
# require these dependencies.

# Face recognition (Windows-friendly)
# On Windows we recommend using dlib-bin which provides prebuilt wheels.
# On Linux/Mac, install `dlib` from your package manager or build tools, then pip install face-recognition.
Pillow>=12.0.0

# Optional: Face recognition (Windows)
# Installing face_recognition via pip will try to build `dlib` from source and fail without CMake.
# To use face recognition on Windows, DO NOT install via this file.
# Instead, run the helper script `install_face_deps.ps1` or follow INSTALL_FACE_RECOGNITION.md.
# This keeps `pip install -r requirements.txt` fast and reliable on all platforms.
